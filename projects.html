                        <p>In a few hours, I was able to design and style a quiz application that allowed a user to choose from multiple choice answers to answer trivia questions. I used HTML to build the structure of the presentation, and JavaScript to add data to the containers. I ran into an issue with answer choices still being "selected" after moving on to the next question. I was able to fix this problem by creating a new function the "de-selected" answer choices after submission.</p>

                        <p>I created and styled a web application that counts down the time until New Years Day in my own free time. This app took a few hours to complete, and accurately calculates the time left in Days, Hours, Minutes, and seconds. I used JavaScript to build the functions that handled the math part of the app, and I used CSS to style the page and make it appealing to the user. The most difficult part was figuring out the conversions from milliseconds to days.</p>

                        <h2>Rolling Dice</h2>
                        <p>I decided to figure out how I could make two dice and their added results display as a graph onto a webpage. In this project, I focused on creating algorithms and building a structure for a display. My application allowed a person to choose between rolling one or one thousand pairs of dice, keep track of how many times each number was rolled, and display a bar graph with the accurate results. I completed this activity in one week. I used Visual Studio Code editor to build procedural programming and math expressions in a JavaScript file, added some style to the webpage using a CSS file.</p>
