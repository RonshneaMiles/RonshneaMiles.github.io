                        <h2>Kenzie Story</h2>
                        <p>Founder Chok Ooi established Kenzie Academy in the summer of 2017 to pioneer a new education model for those looking to prepare for the future of work by retraining with technical skills. Through automation and other technical advancements, tech (or new-collar) jobs are rising and taking the place of the traditional white-collar and blue-collar roles. Chok wanted to prepare students for these new-collar opportunities by teaching a combination of hands-on technical skills and soft, interpersonal skills.</p>
